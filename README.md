# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Analysis Audit:

### Purpose
To automate the vote-counting process for an election and provide an output of the results in an easy to read text file. 

## Election Results:

### Automation Process
To automate the congressional election results, Python code was written in Visual Studio Code which allows users to execute the script using command prompts as well as VS code (see below image). This method was provided per the request from Seth and Tom our clients.

### Outcome of Election Audit
- A total of 369,711 votes were collected. 
- A breakdown of tallied votes and their percentages for each county are provided in a text file. See the image below for quick reference.

## Election Summary:
Thanks to the overall simplicity of the script and its ability to recognize candidates, counties, and votes; it would be easy to apply the code to a larger data set that included more counties, candidates, and voters. It can also be modified to audit the election of a superintendent for a school district. Candidates listed, schools listed in the ISD and counting their votes for each candidate with results quickly and efficiently displayed in an easy to read text file. Subsequently the script could be upscaled to audit elections for individual state, regional, or possibly country elections with minor tweaks to the data set to account for the proper variables required. The possibilities are vast, and only limited by userâ€™s willingness you use the script.
